    <section> The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a
      domesticated canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for
      various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
      Although initially thought to have originated as an artificial variant
      of an extant canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole,
      golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken
      during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like
      canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago Being the oldest domesticated
      animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to be
      uniquely attuned to human behavior, as well as thrive on a starch-rich
      diet which would be inadequate for other canid species.</section>

    <section> The domestic cat (Latin: Felis catus) or the feral cat
      (Latin: Felis silvestris catus) is a small, typically furry,
      carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as
      indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them
      from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for
      companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than
      70 cat breeds; different associations proclaim different numbers
      according to their standards.</section>

    <section> Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order
      Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight
      different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the
      European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus
      Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an
      endangered species on Amami ÅŒshima, Japan). There are many other species
      of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order
      Lagomorpha. The male is called a buck and the female is a doe; a young
      rabbit is a kitten or kit.</section>
